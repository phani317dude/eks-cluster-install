Deffrent region and deffart account

one vpc to another vpc communtion

We can try connacting to my defalut vpc to created vpc (Note :- you can try deffrent region or deffrecnt accoutalso)

VPC Peering • Privately connect two VPCs using AWS’
network
• Make them behave as if they were in the
same network
• Must not have overlapping CIDRs •
 VPC Peering connection is NOT transitive
(must be established for each VPC that
need to communicate with one another)
• You must update route tables in each VPC’s
subnets to ensure EC2 instances can
communicate with each other

VPC Peering – Good to know
• You can create VPC Peering connection between VPCs in different AWS
accounts/regions
• You can reference a security group in a peered VPC (works cross
accounts – same region)
