VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)

 VPC endpoint enables creation of a private connection between VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services

Every AWS service is publicly exposed
(public URL)
• VPC Endpoints (powered by AWS
PrivateLink) allows you to connect to AWS
services using a private network instead of
using the public Internet
• They’re redundant and scale horizontally
• They remove the need of IGW, NATGW, …
to access AWS Services
• In case of issues:
• Check DNS Setting Resolution in your VPC
• Check Route Tables
